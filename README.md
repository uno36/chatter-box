<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The chatbot application utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing techniques to understand and interpret user input. This enables the chatbot to comprehend and respond to user queries or commands in a human-like manner, enhancing the user experience.
- **User Authentication and Personalization:** The application includes a robust user authentication system, allowing users to have personalized interactions with the chatbot. Through authentication, users can access tailored information, preferences, or services based on their individual profiles, providing a more customized and secure experience.
- **Integration with External Services:** The chatbot seamlessly integrates with external services and APIs, expanding its functionality beyond simple conversation. This integration allows users to perform various tasks, such as retrieving real-time information, making transactions, or interacting with external databases, making the chatbot a versatile tool for users.
